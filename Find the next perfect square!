///
we are given sq which is a perfect square number
our task is to find the next biggest perfect square
if the argument is not a perfect square then we return -1
line 5 checks if sq is not a perfect square and returns -1 if truthy
else we take sq and root it. we then add one and square it. this gives us the next biggest perfect square.
