function maskify(cc) {
  return cc.slice(0, -4).replace(/./g, '#') + cc.slice(-4);
}

// cc.slice(0, -4).replace(/./g, '#') takes all the characters from element 0 until the 4 last character and replaces them with '#'. the '.' inside the regex indicates all characters will be targeted execpt for line breaks


alternate using a loop

function maskify(cc) {
  cc = cc.split("");
  for(var i = 0; i < cc.length - 4; i++){
    cc[i] = "#";
}

cc = cc.join("");
return cc
}


// the argument is split into an array
// create a for loop, starting at 0 and running while i is less than the length of cc - 4
// cc[i] is changed into '#'
// cc is currently an array with everything except for last 4 characters set as #. the last 4 remain unchanged
//cc is joined then returned as a string.
