My Solution

var number = function(busStops){
  let totalOn = 0
  let totalOff = 0
  for(let i = 0; i < busStops.length; i++){
    totalOn += busStops[i][0]
    totalOff += busStops[i][1]
  }
  return totalOn - totalOff
}


* goal is to take an array of arrays, sum all the 0th elements in each inner array and subtract, from that sum, all of the values in the 1st element.

*one possible refactor is to have one variable to keep track of people getting on and off. instead of doing += for each counter, you can do += for summing the first value and -= for the 2nd value. 

var number = function(busStops){
  let totalCount = 0
  
  for(let i = 0; i < busStops.length; i++){
    totalCount += busStops[i][0]
    totalOff -= busStops[i][1]
  }
  return totalCount
}
